## YouTube 16.40.36 (Android 5)

> [!CAUTION]
> YouTube ReVanced for Android 5 (16.40.36) is almost dead!  
> In March 2024, YouTube dropped support of 16.01.XX-17.32.XX clients completely.  
> The d4n3436's patch spoofs the app version to 17.33.42 automatically, but it has critical problems.  
> Read [this page](https://github.com/d4n3436/revanced-patches-android5/releases/tag/v2.161.4) to check known issues

<summary>Open guide</summary>

Before patching, download and install [Vanced MicroG for Android 5](https://github.com/TeamVanced/VancedMicroG/releases/tag/v0.2.22.212658-212658001) (d4n3436 patches doesn't support ReVanced GmsCore yet)

Use d4n3436's patches.

> [!WARNING]
> Most Android 5.x devices have ARMv7 (32bit) CPU, so patching may fail.  
> If you got `(exit code = 135)` error, please patch with other device or PC, and move a patched apk to A5.x device.

1. Download YouTube 16.40.36 APK from APKMirror. (Just download. DO NOT install it.)  
https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/youtube/youtube-16-40-36-release/youtube-16-40-36-android-apk-download/
2. Download ReVanced Manager
3. Open [Settings] > [Sources]

5. Restart Manager (important)
6. Open [Patcher] > [Select an application]
7. Tap [Storage] button and choose the APK which you downloaded in step 1.
8. Tap [Patch] button.

After patching is complete, I recommend saving the patched APK from [ðŸ’¾] button.

## Other apps
Since v1.17.1 (December 2023), this ReVanced Manager fork is no longer compatible with official/RVX revanced-patches.

So, if you want to install other ReVanced apps (YT Music, Twitter, TikTok, etc.) on Android 5-7 devices, use other patching methods.

- Official/RVX ReVanced Manager (Android 8.0+)
- [auto-cli](https://github.com/taku-nm/auto-cli) (PC)
- [RVX Builder](https://github.com/inotia00/rvx-builder) (PC/Android 5.0+)
- [Revancify](https://github.com/decipher3114/Revancify) (Android 5.0+)
