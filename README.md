# ReVanced Manager for Android 5.x and 6.0-7.1 (Emulator Version) (ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH x86 AND x86_64!)
This fork is suitable for older/lightweight Android Emulators (Bluestacks/LDPlayer/Nox Nougat) and older Android-x86 builds (Such as: Android-x86 (7/8/9), PrimeOS, PhoenixOS, and POSROG) *(Note: Some list may not be tested yet by me and video playback may not work caused by some bugs by the Emulator/Android-x86.) Also, may works in newer Android-x86 (Such as BlissOS) but need to disable (check-android-version) patch.

## Screenshots: (Coming Soon)

# How to patch

## YouTube 17.34.36 (Android 6 & 7)
Use kitadai31's patches. (default)  
[Click here](https://github.com/kitadai31/revanced-patches-android6-7/wiki/How-to-build)

## YouTube 16.40.36 (Android 5)
Use d4n3436's patches.

> [!CAUTION]
> YouTube ReVanced for Android 5 (16.40.36) is almost dead!  
> In March 2024, YouTube dropped support of 16.01.XX-17.32.XX clients completely.  
> So, YT ReVanced for A5 spoofs the app version to 17.33.42 automatically, but it has critical problems.  
> Read [this page](https://github.com/d4n3436/revanced-patches-android5/releases/tag/v2.161.4) to check known issues

## Other apps
Since v1.17.1 (December 2023), this ReVanced Manager fork is no longer compatible with official/RVX revanced-patches.

So, if you want to install other ReVanced apps (YT Music, Twitter, TikTok, etc.) on Android 5-7 devices, use other patching methods.

- Official/RVX ReVanced Manager (Android 8.0+)
- [auto-cli](https://github.com/taku-nm/auto-cli) (PC)
- [RVX Builder](https://github.com/inotia00/rvx-builder) (PC/Android 5.0+)
- [Revancify](https://github.com/decipher3114/Revancify) (Android 5.0+)
